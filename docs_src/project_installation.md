# Project Installation

Solution is based on [NVIDIA Omniverse](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-omniverse-platform) with Python interface.
There are two ways of installation. End user installation and development installation. *The guide follows Linux based
installation steps*, which is also the recommended option.

## End User Installation

### Docker Compose

To be able to run ArDaGen using Docker Compose, perform following steps:

1. Install Docker ([how to install](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)).
2. Install Docker Compose ([how to install](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)).
3. Pull [NVIDIA Omniverse Isaac Sim Docker image](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/isaac-sim).

## Development Installation

Follow the instruction steps.
**Linux (Ubuntu 22.04) installation was tested only. The installation might not work on Windows.**

```

::::

1. Build Isaac Sim from [GitHub repo](https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacSim).

2. Install [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
**Other IDEs are not supported out of the box, nor tested.**

3. Download the repository using

    ```shell
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/OndrejSzekely/metron_ai_ardagen.git
    ```

4. Move ArDaGen repository into Isaac Sim's build root folder.

    ```shell
    # a sample command, your paths will be different and also Isaac Sim version might not match
    mv  /ssd_crucial/projects/metron_ai_ardagen /ssd_crucial/omniverse/isaacsim/_build/linux-x86_64/release
    ```

5. Install [*uv*](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) tool on your host system.

6. Install project's dependencies using *uv*.

    ::::{admonition} Reference Installation Steps
    :class: tip, dropdown

    ```shell
    uv sync --group devtools --all-extras --inexact --frozen
    ```

7. To start Visual Studio project, go into Isaac Sim's build root folder and run `code .`. It will open a setup Visual
Studio project with everything predefined.

    In the *Explorer* tab whole Isaac Sim folder is present, but everything else, except *metron_ai_garden* folder,
    is irrelevant for the development.

    ```{eval-rst}
    |:clipboard:| |:raised_hand:| Be aware that debuging is performed using the *Python: Current File* option in *Run & Debug*.
    ```

    ::::

8. Append

    ```yaml
    "./metron_ai_ardagen",
    ```

    into `python.analysis.extraPaths` list in
    `<ISAAC_SIM_BUILD_ROOT_FOLDER_PATH>/.vscode/settings.json` file.

9. Install missing Python requirements - go into Isaac Sim's root folder and run
`./python.sh -m pip install -r metron_ai_ardagen/requirements.txt`.

10. Download *Metron AI ArDaGen Omniverse Extension*, which is an *Omniverse* Extension, somewhere on filesystem.

    ```shell
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/OndrejSzekely/metron_ai_ardagen_omni_ext.git
    ```

11. Run *Isaac Sim* and open Extension window (*window* ‚ü∂ *Extensions*). Click on the *gear icon*
    and in *Extension Seatch Paths* add the path to `exts` folder in the cloned
    *Metron AI ArDaGen Omniverse Extension* repository.

## Bug Fixes

#### Bug #1: OV Replicator camera detach fails at the end of data generation

```shell
'dict' object has no attribute 'discard'
  File "/ssd_crucial/omniverse/library/isaac_sim-2022.1.0/exts/omni.replicator.core-1.2.0+cp37/omni/replicator/core/scripts/writer_registry.py", line <line_num>, in detach
```

In `exts/omni.replicator.core<VERSION>/omni/replicator/core/scripts/writer_registry.py` on line **<line_num>** change

```python
cls._render_product_writer_mapping[render_product].discard(writer_name)
```

into

```python
cls._render_product_writer_mapping[render_product].pop(writer_name)
```
